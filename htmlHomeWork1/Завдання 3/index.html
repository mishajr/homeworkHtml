    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    
        
            <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language <u>(HTML)</u></b>is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p> 
                
            <p> Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u>  describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
            <p>  
            <u>HTML</u>  elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u>  pages. With <u>HTML</u>  constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u>  provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u>  elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u>  tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>
            <p>
                <u>HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. <u>HTML</u> tags most commonly come in pairs like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

            <p>
                Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
